### [Quick Reference Tables](fleischner_clickable.md)

=== "Solid nodules"
    | Nodule type | Risk | ≤6 mm | 6–8 mm | >8 mm | Comments |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | **Single** | **Low Risk** | No routine follow-up | CT 6–12 mo; consider CT 18–24 mo | Consider CT ~3 mo, PET/CT and/or biopsy | Consider 12 mo FU in selected suspicious nodules |
    | **Single** | **High Risk** | Optional CT at 12 mo | CT 6–12 mo and CT 18–24 mo | Consider CT ~3 mo, PET/CT and/or biopsy | Higher concern with suspicious morphology / upper lobe, etc. |
    | **Multiple** | **Low Risk** | No routine follow-up | CT 3–6 mo; consider CT 18–24 mo | CT 3–6 mo ± PET/CT/biopsy | Base management on most suspicious nodule |
    | **Multiple** | **High Risk** | Optional CT at 12 mo | CT 3–6 mo and CT 18–24 mo | CT 3–6 mo ± PET/CT/biopsy | Base management on most suspicious nodule |

    **Perifissural note:** If a nodule is perifissural with a polygonal shape (typical intrapulmonary lymph node), **no follow-up** is required.

=== "Subsolid nodules"
    | Nodule type | Pattern | <6 mm | ≥6 mm | Comments |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | **Single** | **Ground-glass** | No routine follow-up | CT 6–12 mo to confirm persistence, then q2y until 5y | Consider longer follow-up if suspicious |
    | **Single** | **Part-solid** | No routine follow-up | CT 3–6 mo to confirm persistence; if persistent, annual CT until 5y (manage by solid component) | Persistent part-solid often higher risk |
    | **Multiple** | **Ground-glass** | CT 3–6 mo; if stable, consider CT at 2 and 4y | CT 3–6 mo; subsequent management guided by most suspicious nodule | Follow most suspicious nodule |
    | **Multiple** | **Part-solid** | CT 3–6 mo; if stable, consider CT at 2 and 4y | CT 3–6 mo; subsequent management guided by most suspicious nodule | Follow most suspicious nodule |

??? tip "How to Measure Nodules"
    
    **Solid Nodules:**
    
    - Measure **longest diameter** in axial plane
    - Use **lung windows** (W: 1500, L: -600)
    - Average diameter if growth assessment needed
    
    **Part-Solid Nodules:**
    
    - Measure **total diameter** (entire nodule)
    - Measure **solid component** separately
    - Solid component determines management
    
    **Ground Glass Nodules:**
    
    - Measure longest diameter
    - Volume measurement preferred when available
    
    **Preferred Method:**
    
    - Semi-automated volumetry when available
    - Volume doubling time (VDT) for growth assessment

### When to Use Lung-RADS Instead

!!! warning "Use Lung-RADS for Screening Exams"
    These Fleischner guidelines apply to **incidental** nodules found on CT performed for other reasons.
    
    For **lung cancer screening CTs**, use [Lung-RADS](lung_rads.md) instead.
