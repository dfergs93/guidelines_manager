## Detailed Classification

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   **Category 0: Incomplete**

    ---

    !!! warning "Additional Imaging Needed"
        **Reasons for Category 0:**
        
        - Prior CT needed for comparison
        - Technically inadequate study
        - Additional imaging recommended (e.g., dedicated chest CT for findings on non-screening CT)

    **Management:** Complete imaging before final classification

-   **Category 1: Negative**

    ---

    !!! success "No Nodules - Annual Screening"
        **Findings:**
        
        - No lung nodules
        - Definitely benign nodules only (completely calcified, fat-containing)

    **Management:** Continue annual LDCT screening in 12 months

    **Malignancy Risk:** <1%

-   **Category 2: Benign Appearance or Behavior**

    ---

        - Growth on interval imaging

    **Management:** Chest CT with or without contrast, PET/CT, and/or tissue sampling depending on probability of malignancy and comorbidities

    **Malignancy Risk:** >15%

-   **Category 4X: Additional Suspicious Features**

    !!! danger "Category 3 or 4 + Clinically Significant Findings"
        **Applies when Category 3 or 4 nodule PLUS:**
        
        - Lymphadenopathy suspicious for lung cancer
        - Suspicious lung mass/nodule features (spiculation, cavity)
        - Endobronchial lesion

    **Management:** Consider chest CT with contrast, PET/CT, and/or tissue sampling

    **Malignancy Risk:** Variable (based on underlying category + additional features)

## Measurement Guidelines

??? tip "How to Measure - Lung-RADS Specific"
    
    **Solid Nodules:**
    
    - Measure **average diameter**: (longest diameter + perpendicular diameter) ÷ 2
    - Use **lung windows** (W: 1500, L: -600)
    - Round to nearest whole millimeter
    
    **Part-Solid Nodules:**
    
    - Measure **total diameter** (entire nodule including ground glass)
    - Measure **solid component** separately using average diameter
    - Solid component determines category
    
    **Ground Glass (Non-Solid) Nodules:**
    
    - Measure average diameter
    - Must obscure vessels but no solid component
    
    **Multiple Nodules:**
    
    - Classify based on **most suspicious nodule**
    - Report up to 3 most significant nodules

---

## Special Modifiers

### S Modifier: Significant or Potentially Significant Findings

Add **"S"** modifier for clinically significant findings unrelated to lung cancer:

- Coronary artery calcification (specify if severe)
- Emphysema (specify if severe)
- Interstitial lung abnormalities
- Infectious/inflammatory conditions requiring treatment

**Example:** Lung-RADS 2S (benign nodule + severe emphysema)

### C Modifier: Previously Known Cancer

**Not used in standard lung cancer screening**

Reserved for incidental CTs in patients with known cancer.

---

## Comparison to Prior Exams

!!! warning "New vs Stable vs Growing Nodules"
    
    **Baseline Exam (No Prior):**
    
    - Classify based on size criteria above
    
    **Subsequent Exams (With Prior):**
    
    - **Stable nodule:** Remains same category or improves → Continue as per category
    - **New nodule:** Not present on prior → Use "new nodule" size criteria
    - **Growing nodule:** ≥1.5 mm increase in average diameter → **Lung-RADS 4B**
    
    **Volume Doubling Time (VDT):**
    
    - VDT <400 days = concerning for malignancy

!!! question "Who Should Be Screened?"
    
    **USPSTF 2021 Criteria:**
    
    - Age **50-80 years**
    - **≥20 pack-year** smoking history
    - Current smoker OR quit within past **15 years**
    - No signs/symptoms of lung cancer

## Common Pitfalls

!!! warning "Avoid These Mistakes"
    
    **❌ Don't:**
    
    - Use Lung-RADS for incidental nodules (use Fleischner instead)
    - Measure nodules in coronal/sagittal only (use axial)
    - Ignore new nodules <4 mm (still report them)
    - Apply to patients outside screening age range
    
    **✅ Do:**
    
    - Always compare to prior exams when available
    - Measure solid component of part-solid nodules
    - Document smoking history in report
    - Communicate high-risk findings (4B, 4X) directly to ordering provider
