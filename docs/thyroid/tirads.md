=== "Management Algorithm"
    | TI-RADS | Size | Recommendation |
    |---------|------|----------------|
    | **TR1** | Any | No FNA, no follow-up |
    | **TR2** | Any | No FNA, no follow-up |
    | **TR3** | <1.5 cm | No FNA, no follow-up |
    | **TR3** | ≥1.5 cm | Consider follow-up US at 1, 3, 5 years |
    | **TR3** | ≥2.5 cm | Consider FNA |
    | **TR4** | <1.0 cm | No FNA, no follow-up |
    | **TR4** | ≥1.0 cm | Consider follow-up US at 1, 2, 3, 5 years |
    | **TR4** | ≥1.5 cm | Consider FNA |
    | **TR5** | <0.5 cm | No FNA, no follow-up |
    | **TR5** | ≥0.5 cm | Consider follow-up US at 1, 2, 3, 5 years |
    | **TR5** | ≥1.0 cm | FNA recommended |

### Scoring Instructions

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   **How to Score**
    - Evaluate all five categories
    - Assign points for each feature
    - Sum total points
    - Determine TI-RADS level
    - Apply size-based recommendations

-   **Key Principles**
    - Score the most suspicious features
    - If multiple features in one category, choose highest points
    - Measure maximum diameter in any plane
    - Consider clinical context

</div>

??? tip "Measurement Guidelines"
    
    **Size Measurement:**
    
    - Use **maximum diameter** in any plane
    - Measure in **centimeters** (to one decimal)
    - Include solid and cystic components
    
    **Important Notes:**
    
    - Benign features (TR1-TR2): No size threshold
    - Always measure at largest diameter
    - Document plane of measurement
    
    **Growth Assessment:**
    
    - Significant growth: >20% in two dimensions AND >2mm
    - Minimum interval: 6 months
    - Use same measurement technique

### Special Considerations

!!! warning "When NOT to Use TI-RADS"
    
    **Do NOT apply TI-RADS to:**
    
    - Nodules in patients <14 years old
    - Nodules with known history of thyroid cancer
    - Lymph nodes
    - Nodules already biopsied or with known cytology
    - Purely cystic nodules (TR1)
    
    **Clinical correlation required for:**
    
    - Rapidly growing nodules
    - Symptomatic nodules (hoarseness, dysphagia)
    - Suspicious lymphadenopathy
    - Elevated thyroglobulin
    - PET-avid nodules

??? tip "Reporting Tips"
    
    **Structured Report Should Include:**
    
    - Overall thyroid size and echogenicity
    - Number of nodules
    - For each nodule requiring characterization:
        - Location (lobe, upper/mid/lower)
        - Size (3 dimensions)
        - Composition (points)
        - Echogenicity (points)
        - Shape (points)
        - Margin (points)
        - Echogenic foci (points)
        - **Total TI-RADS points and level**
        - **Recommendation based on size and TR level**
    
    **Example Template:**
    
    ```
    Right mid lobe nodule measures 1.8 x 1.2 x 1.5 cm:
    - Solid composition (2 points)
    - Hypoechoic (2 points)
    - Wider-than-tall (0 points)
    - Irregular margin (2 points)
    - Punctate echogenic foci (3 points)
    Total: 9 points = TR5
    
    Recommendation: FNA is recommended.
    ```

### Common Pitfalls

!!! danger "Avoid These Errors"
    
    **Scoring Errors:**
    
    - Don't add multiple features from same category
    - Don't upgrade based on size alone
    - Don't confuse macrocalcifications with punctate foci
    
    **Measurement Errors:**
    
    - Don't include halo in measurement
    - Don't measure only transverse plane
    - Don't round up aggressively
    
    **Management Errors:**
    
    - Don't FNA nodules below size threshold
    - Don't ignore clinical context
    - Don't apply to cervical lymph nodes

## Visual Reference Guide

??? example "Image Examples by Category"

    - Taller-than-wide seen on transverse view
    
    **Margin:**
    
    - Smooth: Regular border
    - Lobulated: 3+ undulations
    - ETE: Disruption of thyroid capsule
    
    **Echogenic Foci:**
